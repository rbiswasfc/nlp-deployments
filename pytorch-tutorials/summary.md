# Why shall we use pytorch?
* Stays out of way of the user
* As fast as any other package
* Offers flexibility, popular in research
* Get a real sense of building neural network model, low level
* Can use python standard debugger
* Dynamic computational graph

# Why use GPU?
* GPU can potentially contain 1000+ cores
* Most suitable for parallel computing, tasks that can be broken down into many smaller sub tasks 
* Neural Networks are embarrassingly parallel, all independent computations can be done in parallel
* NVIDIA GPU -> Hardware, CUDA -> Software layer providing API for developers
